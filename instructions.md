# Battleship 

## Instructions

In this implementation, the user is playing on the Computer's grid, while the Computer's ships are randomly placed on its grid. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **User Role (Player)**:

> The user interacts with the Computer's grid by clicking cells to attack.
> The _attack_ function determines whether you hit or miss the Computer's ships.
> Hits are marked with ðŸ”¥ (fire) and misses with ðŸ’§ (water).

2. **Computer's Role**:

> The Computer doesnâ€™t yet attack the user's grid in the current implementation.
> The user's grid is currently there for visual purposes, but it's not used interactively.
